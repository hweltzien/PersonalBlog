# Personal Blog

## Description
After utilizing web-based resources and instructional support, I learned how to dynamically create HTML elements and to display stored data on the DOM. I also learned about the properties of an "event listener." I used an event listener to create a light/dark mode toggle, a "submit" button to direct the user to the next page, and a "back" button to direct the user to a previous page. Moreover, this project further developed my JavaScript knowledge and skills.

## Installation

To clone the assignment, click the green button labeled, "code." Copy the URL for the repository, using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI. Open Git Bash. Change the working directory to the desired location for the cloned directory. Type "git clone" and paste the copied URL. Press "enter" to create your local clone.

## Usage

Beginning on "index.html," the user will see the heading, "Create a New Post" and a form to collect user input. After completing the form and upon clicking the "submit" button, the user is directed to "blog.html." The user will see the heading, "Recent Posts" and is presented with user input in a grid template. In the footer, there is a link to the author's portfolio. The user can click the "back" button to complete the form again. Both pages have a light/dark mode toggle.
